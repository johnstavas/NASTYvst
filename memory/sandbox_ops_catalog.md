# Sandbox Ops Catalog — 1–183 flat index

Living checklist of every op slot in the sandbox DSP primitive set. Organised
by family; the number in the first column is the **canonical catalog ID** and
is permanent. The `status` column is the single source of truth for "what's
done vs. what's left".

> **Phase 4 closure — 2026-04-25 ✅.** Op-ship line **UNPAUSED**. Native
> parity is now a permanent ship gate per `ship_blockers.md` § 8. All 39
> ops in `test/fixtures/parity/per_op_specs.json` are parity-green at
> declared tolerance (full sweep ALL PASS, golden hashes 250/250 PASS,
> verified 2026-04-25). Parity-verified op set: `gain, abs, sign, scaleBy,
> clamp, polarity, uniBi, constant, polarity_inv, uniBi_b2u, dcBlock,
> onePole_lp, onePole_hp, svf_lp, ladder, gain_chain2, biquad_{lp,hp,bp,
> notch,peak,lowshelf,highshelf}, drive, mix, softLimit, saturate, bitcrush,
> hardClip, wavefolder, diodeClipper, shelf_low, allpass, tilt, chebyshevWS,
> korg35, diodeLadder, smooth, slew`. New ops shipped after this date
> require the 7-step protocol (`sandbox_op_ship_protocol.md`) including
> Step 6 native-parity green BEFORE flipping ✅+P in this catalog.


> **🛑 2026-04-26 TRUST RESET.** Every op in the main catalog table was
> demoted to 🚧 status on this date. Prior ✅ marks were inherited from
> batched/automated work without per-op personal verification. After we
> discovered four silent C++ stubs (detector / envelope / filter /
> gainComputer) marked ✅ that were emitting zeros into every shipped
> compressor recipe, the decision was: **no more inherited trust**.
> Each op now earns ✅+P+✓ only after individual verification through the
> 7-gate protocol (worklet real, C++ real, smoke graph, T1–T7 sweep, T8
> native parity, T8-B behavioral, listen-and-sign-off). Live ledger:
> `memory/op_verification_ledger.md`. Run `node scripts/audit_op_progress.mjs`
> to see auto-detectable gate progress (gates 1–6); gate 7 is manual.

## Status legend
- ✅+P+✓ **shipped + parity-verified + behaviorally-verified** (NEW 2026-04-26 ·
  T8-B closure). Tri-file set complete + math + golden blessed + `qc:parity`
  green + `qc:behavioral` worklet PASS + (native PASS or documented SKIP).
  This is the new gold standard for shipped rows. Backfill to existing ✅+P
  ops happens as behavioral specs land (Day 6+ schedule per
  `behavioral_validation_harness.md`).
- ✅+P  **shipped + parity-verified, behavioral pending** — tri-file set
  complete + math + golden blessed + `qc:parity` green at declared tolerance.
  Pre-T8-B state. All currently ✅+P ops migrate to ✅+P+✓ as behavioral
  specs are added; ops with `codegen-or-wiring-bug` attribution (e.g., tilt
  as of 2026-04-26) stay at ✅+P pending C++ patch + golden re-bless.
- ✅+P~ **shipped + parity-verified with declared widening** — same as ✅+P
  but with a per-op tolerance widening documented in
  `test/fixtures/parity/per_op_specs.json` `note` field (e.g., neural ops
  using cents tolerance instead of bit-exact).
- ✅    **legacy "shipped" mark** — pre-Phase-4 transitional. Many existing
  rows still display ✅ rather than ✅+P; treat as "shipped, and either
  parity-verified (if op appears in `test/fixtures/parity/per_op_specs.json`)
  or parity-not-yet-built-as-fixture (if not)." All 39 ops in the parity
  fixture set are ✅+P after Phase 4 closure 2026-04-25 (see closure block
  below). Future per-row promotion happens when the doc is next touched.
- 🔧    **parity-pending** — fix in flight (ops paused mid-debug; see
  `qc_backlog.md` for diff signature).
- 🚧    **registry-only** — entry exists in `src/sandbox/opRegistry.js` but no
  sidecar yet (so shape-check would trip if included in OP_IDS).
- ⬜    **not started** — no registry entry, no files.

### T8-B closure summary (2026-04-26 — updated after second backfill pass)

**33 of 46 parity ops** have committed two-arm behavioral reports across
5 categories (compressor, utility, filter, distortion, analyzer):
- **28 ops verified end-to-end** (worklet PASS + native PASS) → eligible
  for ✅+P+✓ promotion when catalog rows are next touched.
- **5 ops native-skipped** with documented architectural reason:
  - 4 Cluster A cells (varMuTube, fetVVR, blackmerVCA, diodeBridgeGR) —
    audio + cv input shape not driveable by single-WAV parity_host
  - mix — dry + wet input shape, same single-WAV constraint
- **0 confirmed codegen-or-wiring bugs.** The original tilt finding was
  resolved as a harness param-normalization bug (not a tilt op bug):
  run_native was using stale per_op_specs.json paramRanges instead of
  the authoritative param_ranges.json sidecar emitted by codegen. Fixed
  2026-04-26.

**13 of 46 parity ops not yet covered** — require infrastructure work
beyond spec authoring (worklet-less builtin-reference ops, resampler,
modulation generators, source ops). See `sandbox_ops_research_debt.md`
T8-B harness backlog for the full ledger.

Reports live in `test/fixtures/behavioral/reports/<opId>.{md,json}`.

2026-04-26 dedup-recovery pass adds 7 more ⬜ slots (#177–#183) —
1 Tier-A (fmOperator) + 6 Tier-B — closing the 11-slot gap to the
original synthesis count.
Pre-sweep state: 125 of ~140 ops shipped (~89%). Catalog extended

Why these specifically: cannot be cleanly composed from existing primitives.
Each has a distinct topology (non-monotonic transfer for #131, exponential
I-V for #132, discontinuous derivative for #133, Chebyshev polynomial basis
for #134, distinct ladder topology for #135–136, parabolic stand-in for #137,
sparse-noise generator for #138). Demoted to brick-layer (NOT new ops):
brickwallLimiter, multibandCompressor, deEsser, pingPongDelay, tapeDelay,
parametricEQ, vocoder, autoTune, ambisonics, robotization/whisperization —
all compose from shipped primitives.

| 8  | smooth   | 🚧 | 1-pole τ-smoother |
| 9  | combine  | 🚧 | mul/add/max/min/weighted |
| 29 | scaleBy  | 🚧 | linear multiplier; k=1 bypass, k=0 mute, k=-1 polarity flip |
| 30 | polarity | 🚧 | switchable phase flip (bool param), gain-lossless sign-bit flip; preferred over scaleBy(-1) for UI clarity and null-test routing (x + polarity(x) = 0) |
| 31 | constant | 🚧 | zero-input fixed-value source; NaN/±Inf rejected (sticky last-good); instant jump on setParam (wrap w/ smooth for click-free ramps); DC bias / mod-port default / stub-out utility |
| 89 | abs      | 🚧 | |x| full-wave rectifier; partner of `sign` for magnitude/polarity splits; NaN preserved |
| 90 | clamp    | 🚧 | min/max saturator; control-safety primitive |
| 91 | sign     | 🚧 | three-valued sign(x) ∈ {-1,0,+1}; NaN→0 (was generic `math` placeholder, reassigned) |
| 92 | fanOut   | 🚧 | explicit 1→4 unity-gain splitter; graph already supports multi-connect, but named distribution node aids readability + instrumentation; unwired outputs skipped |
| 93 | z1       | 🚧 | y[n]=x[n-1]; atomic feedback primitive — minimum-latency cycle-breaker; Float64 state + denormal flush; latency=1; chainable for multi-sample delays |
| 94 | uniBi    | 🚧 | uni↔bi range remap (mod-router primitive); uniToBi=2x-1, biToUni=(x+1)/2; linear (no clamp); numeric or string mode accepted; per sandbox_modulation_roadmap.md |
| 95 | slew     | 🚧 | linear-rate slew limiter, asymmetric rise/fall (ms per unit); sharp corners at rate transitions (no exponential tail — sister op to `smooth`); Float64 state + denormal flush; zero latency (transients attenuated, not delayed); default 10ms rise / 50ms fall matches analog envelope follower |
| 96 | trigger  | 🚧 | Schmitt trigger w/ hysteresis (arm≥threshHi / disarm≤threshLo) + optional rising-edge pulse; gate mode = persistent 1 while armed, pulse mode = single-sample tick on arm-up; inverted thresholds coerced; Canon:dynamics §4 (beat detector pattern extracted as primitive) |
| 97 | ramp     | 🚧 | triggered one-shot linear ramp generator; rising-edge trig starts sweep startVal→endVal over timeMs then holds; timeMs=0 = instant jump (clean latch-on-trigger utility); sister to `slew` (reactive) and `envelope` (signal-driven), complements `lfo` (free-running periodic) |
| 98 | quantizer | 🚧 | snap-to-grid quantiser for control signals; y=offset+f((x−offset)/step)·step with f∈{round,floor,ceil}; step=0 bypass; negative step → abs; distinct from bitcrush (arbitrary-step any-range vs 2^bits amplitude); use for stepped LFO, semitone-snap pitch CV, N-position macro |
| 99 | glide    | 🚧 | constant-time glide / portamento; each target change recomputes step = (newTarget − y)/glideSamples so y arrives in glideMs regardless of distance; first-sample snap (no from-zero glide); glideMs=0 instant; mid-glide retarget honors new time-to-target from current y; distinct from slew (const rate) and smooth (exponential asymptote) |

| 125 | hiss                     | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. **Two open primaries**: (1) feldkirch "Fast Whitenoise Generator" musicdsp archive (2006-02-23) — two 32-bit XOR-add counters scaled by `2/0xffffffff`, seeds `x1=0x67452301, x2=0xefcdab89` (SHA-1 IVs); (2) Paul Kellett "Filter to make pink noise from white" (musicdsp/pink.txt, March 2000) — refined 7-tap weighted sum of 1st-order filters, ±0.05 dB above 9.2 Hz at 44.1 kHz, unity gain at Nyquist. Both ported verbatim. PRNG: `x1^=x2; out=x2·SCALE; x2+=x1`. Kellett pink: `b0=0.99886·b0+white·0.0555179; ...; pink=Σb_i+white·0.5362; b6=white·0.115926`. Design picks NOT math-by-def (carved): (i) Kellett coefs sample-rate-locked at 44.1 kHz; Lubomir's ranged tables are upgrade path (debt a); (ii) PRNG not CSPRNG-grade (debt b); (iii) `y·=0.11` post-scale to match pink-RMS↔white-RMS under shared `level` dB (empirical, not in Kellett — debt c). Params: `level∈[-60,0]` dB default −24, `tint∈{0 white, 1 pink}` default 1. Pure source, zero-latency. Golden committed. 14/14 tests PASS (finiteness, bounds, spectral tilt pink<white, level dB accuracy ±12/−60 dB, white RMS ≈ 0.577, determinism, block continuity, DC≈0). |

| 61 | envelopeFollower | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary: Bram de Jong, "Envelope follower with different attack and release", musicdsp.org archive #136, 2003-01-15 (open). Verbatim recursion: `if (|x|>env) env = atk·(env−|x|) + |x|; else env = rel·(env−|x|) + |x|`. Coefficient formula per Bram: `coef = exp(log(0.01)/(ms·sr·0.001))` — **−40 dB time-constant convention** (time for env to fall 100 %→1 %), ~4.6× faster than the e-folding (1/e) convention used by this codebase's #4 envelope. **Distinct from #4 envelope**: #4 is control-rate + amount/offset remap (modulation use, e-folding τ); #61 is audio-rate raw linear magnitude (sidechain/meter use, Bram −40 dB τ). Added non-primary RMS mode (mode=1, smoothed x² → √) using release coef per Zölzer DAFX §4.2 style; flagged as debt (a). Params: `attack∈[0.1,1000]` default 5 ms, `release∈[1,5000]` default 120 ms, `mode∈{0 peak,1 RMS}` default 0. Zero-latency, one-sided output. Golden committed. 16/16 math tests PASS (DC rise, −40 dB release convention, attack lag, release decay, rectification symmetry, RMS settles to sig/√2, one-sidedness, block continuity). |

Round-trip op: in → 2× up → pair(prevOdd,curEven) → 2× down → out. Latency=1. Golden 881a62d8b9f94b66…. |

Latency 31 samples. JS↔native parity bit-exact (-100 dB tol). First FIR-bearing op shipped through codegen — discovery surface for the MasterGraph stereo state-isolation bug (codegen_design.md §4.1, ship_blockers.md §7); regression-gated by `qc:stereo`. |

Primary: Wikipedia "Jiles-Atherton_model" (verbatim equations: `H_e=H+α·M`, `M_an=M_s·(coth(H_e/a)−a/H_e)`, `B=μ₀(H+M)`; original JMMM paper paywalled). Ships `y = output·[L(drive·x+bias) − L(bias)]` with L(x)=coth(x)−1/x (Taylor near 0 for numerical safety). DC-bias term removes static offset while preserving even-harmonic content (asymmetric core magnetization). Deviations: (1) anhysteretic-only — no hysteresis loop (no irreversible branch, no memory); (2) no freq-dep saturation (missing Φ=∫V·dt pre-integrator); (3) no HF loss (leakage L + winding C roll-off not modeled); (4) α inter-domain coupling term not exposed. Golden `32dd8faeb67388f7…`. 2026-04-24. |
| 112 | tapeSim         | 🚧 | Magnetic tape character — 3-stage chain: gloubi-boulga waveshape → RBJ peaking biquad (head-bump) → 1-pole LP (HF loss). Primaries opened: (A) **Gloubi-boulga** musicdsp #86 (Laurent de Soras 2002, verbatim: `x=in·0.686306; a=1+exp(sqrt(|x|)·-0.75); out=(e^x − e^-xa)/(e^x + e^-x)`). (B) **RBJ peakingEQ** w3.org/TR/audio-eq-cookbook verbatim: `b0=1+αA, b1=-2cos ω₀, b2=1-αA, a0=1+α/A, a1=-2cos ω₀, a2=1-α/A` with `A=10^(dB/40)`, `α=sin(ω₀)/(2Q)`. (C) 1-pole LP `α=1-exp(-2π·fc/Fs)` math-by-definition. Peak uses DF2T. Params: drive, bumpHz, bumpDb, bumpQ, hfHz, trim. Deferred: hysteresis, wow/flutter, pre-emphasis, speed-calibrated HF ceiling. Golden `24d5b7de6e51770a…`. 2026-04-24. |

PRIMARY: `ToTape9Proc.cpp` (806 lines, github.com/airwindows/airwindows raw, fetched to `node_modules/.totape9_primary.cpp`). 12-stage chain ported verbatim: Dubly encode → flutter (1000-sample circular + LCG-jittered sin sweep) → 9-threshold golden-ratio bias/slew (spacing=φ=1.618033988…) + under-bias sticking → tiny hysteresis leak → pre-avg cascade (2/4/8/16/32-tap) → **Taylor-sin saturator** clamp ±2.305929007734908, coefs `/6, /69, /2530.08, /224985.6, /9979200` (lines 223-234, "degenerate Taylor sin()") → post-avg cascade → head-bump **tan-K dual-biquad BPF** (reso=0.618033988…=1/φ, A/B staggered B.freq=0.9375·A.freq, cubic soft-clip `x-=x³·0.0618/√ovs` pre-biquad, lines 65-81,284-305) → Dubly decode → output gain. Stereo→mono, double→float. Skipped: ClipOnly3 post-limiter (→ #88 softLimit), noise-shape dither (→ #114). xorshift PRNG seeded 17 per Airwindows canonical init. 8 params all 0..1 normalized. Debt against #112 logged. Golden `3f9e3e603910bce9…`. 2026-04-24. |

PRIMARY: `normankoren.com/Audio/Tubemodspice_article.html` fetched to `node_modules/.koren_primary.html`, eq.(4): `E1 = (EP/kP)·log(1+exp(kP·(1/μ + EG/sqrt(kVB+EP²))))`, `IP = (E1^X/kG1)·(1+sgn(E1))`. 12AX7 params from Koren's table: μ=100, X=1.4, kG1=1060, kP=600, kVB=300. Sandbox mapping (math-by-definition): `EG = -bias + drive·x`, subtract quiescent IP0=koren(-bias), scale by kg1/400. Memoryless waveshaper — asymmetric: positive side soft-saturates via softplus curve, negative side hard-clips at cutoff (IP=0 when E1≤0). Overflow guards on inner>30 / inner<-30 (<1e-13 error). Deviations: no grid-current above EG=0, no plate-load dynamic coupling, no Miller HF roll-off (compose externally: #9 shelf, #17 dcBlock, #111 transformerSim). 9 params expose full Koren parameter vector for tube-swapping. Golden `6f456deecdf6b20b…`. 2026-04-24. |

Verbatim coefs: F9={2.412,-3.370,3.937,-4.174,3.353,-2.205,1.281,-0.569,0.0847}, ME9, IE9, IE5, F3, Simple2. Canonical loop (NOT the primary's unrolled version — that has an EH-index typo, flagged in header). TPDF wi·(r1-r2) dither. Order snap 2|3|5|9; weighting 0..3 only active at order=9. Deterministic LCG (Canon:synthesis §10). Golden `b8a601fe7aefe136…`. 2026-04-24. |

Kellett constants: `w=2^(bits-1); wi=1/w; o=wi/2`. C-truncation floor fix for negative `tmp`. Deterministic LCG (Canon:synthesis §10) replaces `rand()` for golden stability. Output stays float (simulated bit reduction, not int conversion — sandbox pipeline constraint). Params: bits(1..24), shape(0..1 feedback gain), seed. Golden `616ddc32c31263bb…`. 2026-04-24. |
| 116 | chamberlinZeroCross | 🚧 | Sign-magnitude DAC zero-crossing character (Chamberlin 1985 §12.4, physical book — PRIMARY NOT DIRECTLY OPENED, math-by-definition paraphrase). Two artifacts: (1) dead zone `|x|<dz → 0` (sign-mag missing two's-comp ±LSB adjacency); (2) one-sample spike `±glitch` at each sign change (DAC code-flip settling transient). Wikipedia crossover-distortion consulted for mechanism cross-check (same subjective kink character, different cause). Rasp-on-slow-crossings not modeled (debt). Golden `25c298a2db3b774a…`. 2026-04-24. |
| 117 | fpDacRipple     | 🚧 | Floating-point DAC ripple (ValhallaVintageVerb 70s/80s-mode fingerprint). **PRIMARY NOT DIRECTLY OPENED** — Costello's algorithm closed-source; Valhalla public statements describe the concept only, no verbatim math. Concept sources (via WebSearch 2026-04-24): Sean Costello KVR synthesis ("12 bit 'floating point' ADC/DACs of the RMX16 ... clever hardware that would add 3 bits of gain staging ... added a bit of noise to his '12 bit floating point DAC' code"); Sound On Sound RMX16 review (2 bits gain-ranging; conflicts with Costello's 3 — parameterized). Structural ref: Wikipedia "Block floating point" + TI SPRA948. Ships math-by-definition: per-sample `e = clamp(floor(-log2|x|), 0, expBits)`, mantissa quantize `round(x·2^e·M)/M` with `M=2^(bits-1)`, reconstruct `·2^-e`, add exponent-scaled tail noise (Costello fix for decaying-tail fizzle). Params: bits(4..16, 12=RMX16), expBits(0..4, 3=Costello), noise(0..0.01), seed. Deterministic LCG. Golden `bfe1c79c14fd8bbc…`. 2026-04-24. |

Primary: Haas 1951 "Über den Einfluss eines Einfachechos auf die Hörsamkeit von Sprache" Acustica 1(2):49-58 / JAES 1972 20(2):146-159 — **AES-paywalled, not opened**. Accessible secondary: Wikipedia "Precedence effect" (fetched 2026-04-24) restating Haas's four time-window thresholds verbatim: <2 ms summing-localization; 2-5 ms precedence; 5-30 ms echo-suppression with up to +10 dB lagging-level headroom; >30 ms discrete echo. DSP **core** is math-by-definition (ring-buf delay + scalar gain + routing + crossfade); primary constrains only param ranges & defaults. Two sub-decisions NOT math-by-def, shipped without primary consult: (1) fractional-delay tap = first-order linear interp — menu alternatives (Hermite / Niemitalo / Thiran) documented in JOS PASP Ch.4, Zölzer DAFX §11.3, Canon:time §1–3; (2) stereo `in2` summed at scalar ×0.5 — equal-power ×1/√2 is the correlated-source alternative. Both upgrade paths in research_debt #105 (i) + (j). Ship: `delayMs∈[0,50]` default 18 (mid echo-suppression window), `levelDb∈[-24,+10]` default 0 (Haas ceiling honored), `side∈{0,1}`, `mix∈[0,1]`. Stereo input auto-sums to mono before widening. Outputs L/R audio-rate. Golden `5e30d246bc68a8d5…`. 16/16 math tests PASS. |
| 106 | microDetune | 🚧 | Two-tap crossfading delay-line pitch shifter (Faust `transpose` from misceffects.lib, MIT). Cents-param surface, positive-modulo phase wrap, 200 ms ring buffer cap. 14 tests incl. octave-up/down ZC ratios + block-boundary continuity. |
| 107 | schroederChain | 🚧 | Schroeder 1962 JAES "Natural Sounding Artificial Reverberation" — 4 parallel combs (29.7/37.1/41.1/43.7 ms) → 2 series allpasses (5.0/1.7 ms, g=0.7); per-comb g=10^(−3τ/T60); opt-in Moorer 1979 damping LPF in comb FB; stereo via Freeverb `spread` offset; first digital reverb — ancestor of #20/#108/#109/#110 |
| 108 | plate      | 🚧 | Dattorro 1997 JAES verbatim Fig.1 + Table 2; synthetic stereo from mono tank. **Lexicon 224 lineage** — Dattorro's figure was authored by David Griesinger (Lexicon chief scientist, 1977 Lexicon 224 prototype onward) and published with Griesinger's written permission (see `Downloads/Griesinger.pdf` attribution letter). This op IS the canonical substrate for any Lexicon 224 / 480L / PCM-family clone — tune via `decay` (tank RT60), `damping` (HF absorption = 224 "HF Cut"), `bandwidth` (input 1-pole LPF = 224 "Bass"/rolloff), `modDepth`/`modRateHz` (EXCURSION=16 samples @ ~1 Hz matches 224 chorus default), `size` (uniform delay-line scale). Do NOT ship a separate `lexicon224`/`griesingerTank` op — it would duplicate this topology verbatim. |

Primary: libbs2b v3.1.0 (Boris Mikhaylov, MIT) — canonical open implementation of Bauer 1961 "Stereophonic Earphones and Binaural Loudspeakers" concept (AES paywalled, paraphrased via bs2b math). Ported verbatim from `DeaDBeeF-Player/bs2b/libbs2b-3.1.0/src/bs2b.c` L131–L215. Coefficient init and per-sample topology: two one-pole IIRs per channel (lowpass on cross-fed signal, high-shelf on direct), cross-summed `L=hi[L]+lo[R]`, `R=hi[R]+lo[L]`, then `·gain` where `gain = 1/(1−G_hi+G_lo)` compensates the bass-boost allpass loss. Coefficient derivation: `GB_lo=feed·−5/6−3`, `GB_hi=feed/6−3` (dB), `G_lo=10^(GB_lo/20)`, `G_hi=1−10^(GB_hi/20)`, `Fc_hi=Fc_lo·2^((GB_lo−20log10 G_hi)/12)`. Only deviation: user `feed` param is dB directly (bs2b stores tenths-dB internally; pre-divide dropped). Params: `fcut∈[300,2000]` default 700 Hz, `feed∈[1,15]` default 4.5 dB. Zero-latency, denormal-safe (x<1). Golden committed. 14/14 math tests PASS (hard-L→R bleed, mono=allpass unity, swap symmetry, separation scales with feed, DC-pass, determinism, block continuity). |

Memoryless primitive (delays belong to surrounding waveguide sections); composable into branched tubes / T-junctions / asymmetric horns that the uniform #87a kellyLochbaum lattice can't express. |k|≤0.99 passivity clamp. Latency=0. Golden `5e30d246bc68a8d5…`. 2026-04-24. |

Direct-form v1: IR captured from `ir` input stream over first `length` samples (emits zero during capture), then frozen; `in` convolved each sample via O(M) inner product over a length-M history ring. `length` clamped [1,4096]; latency = length. FFT-based overlap-add (Wikipedia §Overlap-add_method / JOS SASP §Overlap_Add_Decomposition) tracked as P2 upgrade for long IRs. Float64 state, Watte denormal flush, defensive null I/O. |
| 64 | fft                  | 🚧 | Cooley-Tukey iterative radix-2 (Wikipedia / Cormen Ch. 30). Canon:analysis §5 (QFT) is a convolution-reverb-targeted external tar.gz with single-precision stability limits — not appropriate baseline.

Levinson-Durbin reused from #71 lpc. Inverse filter = warped-FIR allpass chain (canonical `z⁻¹ → D(z)` substitution; not in primary, declared deviation). Default λ=0.65 (Bark-like at 48 kHz). order ∈ [1,32], blockN ∈ [64,8192], lambda ∈ [−0.99, 0.99]. Silence-gate + |k|≤0.999 stability clamp. Shipped 2026-04-24. |

ISC. Pipeline: power spec (re²+im²) → chroma filterbank (log-freq Gaussian bumps mod octave, L2 col-norm, Gaussian dominance window centred at ctroct=5 oct over A0) → L∞ per-frame norm. Pitch-class argmax verified: A4→bin 9 (C-based), C4→bin 0, octave-invariance 440↔880 Hz. Defaults: size=1024, nChroma=12, tuning=0, ctroct=5, octwidth=2, baseC=1. DC masked.

Worklet ring-buffer chronological-ordering bug found via real ORT inference (naïve `.slice()` of the storage-order ring after wraparound put a discontinuity mid-frame and the CNN drifted ~12¢) — fixed in both worklet (`snapshot[i] = _frameBuf[(wp+i)%FRAME_SIZE]`) and cpp.jinja mirror; same fix applied to native path. New harness `scripts/check_ml_inference.mjs` (gated `qc:ml` script + `qc:ml:strict`; folded into `qc:all`); 11 tolerance-based tests pass — getSession lazy/memo, A4-440=±5¢, A3-220=±10¢, A5-880=±5¢, A2-110=±10¢, C4-261.63=±5¢, white-noise confidence<0.5, silence finite, determinism≤0.5¢, MessageChannel end-to-end, full worklet→runtime integration over 1 s of host-rate 440 Hz @ 48 kHz=±5¢. Skips gracefully if ORT-Node missing or weights absent (unless `--strict`). **PRIMARY SOURCES CONSULTED (both stages):** (1) Architecture: Kim et al. ICASSP 2018 §2 (paper) + `marl/crepe/core.py:build_and_load_model` (MIT, code-wins). (2) Weights: github.com/yqzhishen/onnxcrepe v1.1.0 `tiny.onnx` (MIT, weights converted from marl/crepe Keras MIT). (3) Inference reference: `marl/crepe/core.py:to_local_average_cents` (verbatim 9-bin ±4 weighted-mean recipe) + `predict()`. **DIFF VS REFERENCE:** I/O contract + cents grid + zero-mean unit-variance normalize all mirror reference. Verified single-frame decode: 440 Hz sine → 440.424 Hz (1.7¢ from truth). Tolerances widened from a flat 5¢ to 5¢/10¢ banded by frequency to honor CREPE-tiny's published RPA ≈0.92 single-frame reality (centre of trained distribution clean at 5¢; lower octaves widen). Worklet/native asymmetry declared in header (microsoft/onnxruntime#13072 — ORT-Web cannot run inside `AudioWorkletGlobalScope`; main-thread `MLRuntime` proxies frames over `AudioWorkletNode.port`; native path runs ORT-native inline). **STAGE 3 — native ORT-native wiring (this ship):** new shared shim `src/sandbox/host/ml_runtime_native.{h,cpp}.jinja` (`shags::ml::MLRuntimeNative` class — lazy `Ort::Session` cache keyed by opId, per-op typed `runCrepe(frame, frameLen) → CrepeResult` helper, pre-allocated 360-bin output buffer to avoid audio-thread alloc, `Ort::SessionOptions` tuned for low-latency: 1 intra-op thread, ORT_ENABLE_ALL graph optimizations, CPU EP). Decoder C++ port `decodeCrepe()` is a verbatim line-for-line mirror of `DECODERS.crepe` in `MLRuntime.js` — same argmax/9-bin/cents-grid/Hz pipeline, identical to JS within float epsilon. CMake fragment `ml_runtime_native.cmake.jinja` emits the JUCE `juce_add_binary_data` stanza for `crepe.onnx` (resource symbols `ShagsPlugModels::crepe_onnx`/`crepe_onnxSize`) + locates ORT-native via `find_package(onnxruntime)` w/ `ORT_DIR` env-var fallback + cross-platform shared-lib linkage (Win .dll/.lib, macOS .dylib, Linux .so). `op_crepe.cpp.jinja` rewritten: mock estimator gone, `dispatchFrame()` snapshots ring chronologically (Stage-2 fix mirrored), normalizes z-mean/u-std, calls `mlRuntime->runCrepe(snap.data(), FRAME_SIZE)`. Op holds non-owning `MLRuntimeNative*` wired by codegen at construction. Constructor + `setParam(const char*, double)` brought into canonical cpp.jinja convention (mirrors `OpFft`/`OpLpc`); `namespace shags::ops` added. Fail-safe: if `mlRuntime == nullptr` (graph emitted without weights, or unit-test isolation), op holds last (f0, conf) — same fail-safe the worklet uses pre-MessagePort-attach. Stage-3 native test harness deferred to T8 codegen integration (no JUCE/CMake build chain in sandbox repo); cross-language decoder regression pin lives in `qc:ml` as 4 synthetic-salience fixtures (peak at bin 180, weighted-mean over symmetric 9-bin window, edge-clamp at bins 0/359, silent/negative salience) — same fixtures will replay against `decodeCrepe()` in the future native harness. **15 of 15 `qc:ml` tests green.** **PRIMARY SOURCES (Stage 3):** ONNX Runtime C++ API headers (Ort::Env, Ort::Session, Ort::Value, Ort::MemoryInfo) + JUCE 8 `juce_add_binary_data` docs + ORT release tarball layout; decoder algorithm: same `marl/crepe/core.py:to_local_average_cents` already cited for Stage 2. **REMAINING WORK:** T8 codegen integration (JUCE plugin scaffold, CMake build server, Stage-3 native test gating) — non-blocking; sandbox + WAM both ship the worklet+MLRuntime path. |

| 131 | wavefolder    | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary: **Faust `ef.wavefold`** (David Braun, MIT — `faust_misceffects.lib` lines 1243–1259, header citing **U. Zölzer "Digital Audio Signal Processing" Ch 10 Fig 10.7**, Wiley 2022). Verbatim Faust passage in worklet header. Algorithm: `makeOdd(f, x)` makes the transfer odd-symmetric; `f(x) = ((x>1−2a) ? tri : x)·g` with `a = width·0.4`, `g = 1/(1−2a)` peak normalization, `tri = 1 − 2.5a + a·|frac((x−(1−2a))/(2a)) − 0.5|`. Buchla 259 / Serge DUSG fold-back fingerprint — **non-monotonic** transfer that cannot be composed from tanh/Padé/softLimit (all monotonic sigmoids). At width=0 → pass-through; at width=1 → fold-zone starts at \|x\|=0.2, peaks at +1, valleys at \|x\|=0.6 / 1.4. Authoring contract mirrors saturate: `drive` (1–8, pre-gain into fold), `width` (0–1, fold shape), `trim` (−24..+12 dB post-gain). Stateless. Golden committed `5fe9d191ec4f7996…`. 17/17 math tests PASS (pass-through at width=0, Faust ref match across drive/width/trim sweep, peak +1 at threshold, valley=0 at first fold, non-monotonicity, odd symmetry, drive pushes through valleys, integer-cycle DC=0). ADAA per Parker-Esqueda-Bilbao DAFx 2016 tracked as P2 upgrade. |
| 132 | diodeClipper  | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary: **Shockley diode equation** (Sedra-Smith "Microelectronic Circuits" 6e §3.2; W. Shockley, Bell Sys Tech J 28, 1949) + **Yeh DAFx 2008** "Simulation of the diode limiter in guitar distortion circuits" closed-form derivation + **Pakarinen-Yeh DAFx 2009** asymmetric extensions. Algorithm: closed-form arcsinh diode-pair clipper. From op-amp inverting-stage with anti-parallel diodes in feedback `I_d(v)=2·I_s·sinh(v/(η·V_t))`, the implicit equation `v_in = R_f·I_s·sinh(v_out/V_t)` solves analytically to `v_out = η·V_t·arcsinh(v_in/(η·V_t·R_f·I_s))`. Collapsing physical constants into `drive` and peak-normalizing: `y_sym = arcsinh(drive·x)/arcsinh(drive)`. Asymmetric mode reduces drive on negative side (`driveN = drive·(1−asym)`) — Tube Screamer / Big Muff signature, generates DC offset and even harmonics. Distinct from saturate (Padé tanh, bounded asymptote) and softLimit (threshold-Padé): log-asymptotic past knee, NOT bounded. Params: `drive ∈ [1,16]`, `asym ∈ [0,1]`, `trim ∈ [−24,+12] dB`. Stateless. Golden committed `f0aafe1da63c142f…`. 18/18 math tests PASS (closed-form sweep, peak norm, bounded, drive monotonicity, log-asymptote distinct from tanh, asym DC offset, asym=1 half-wave-rectifier limit, trim post-gain). Wright Omega WDF (Faust vaeffects.lib Centaur) tracked as P2 upgrade for sub-V_t accuracy. |
| 133 | hardClip      | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary (naive form): **Canon:character §5 "Branchless Clip" — Laurent de Soras 2004, musicdsp.org #81 (public-domain)**: `clip(x,a,b) = (\|x−a\| − \|x−b\| + (a+b))·0.5`. For symmetric ±T this reduces to `(\|x+T\| − \|x−T\|)·0.5`. Primary (ADAA mode): **Parker-Esqueda-Bilbao DAFx 2016 §III** "Antiderivative Antialiasing for Memoryless Nonlinearities". 1st-order ADAA: `y[n] = (F(x[n])−F(x[n−1]))/(x[n]−x[n−1])` where `F(u) = T·u−T²/2 if u>T; u²/2 if \|u\|≤T; −T·u−T²/2 if u<−T`. Ill-conditioned `\|Δx\|<eps` falls back to `0.5(f(x[n])+f(x[n−1]))`. Distinct from saturate/softLimit: discontinuous derivative at threshold → brick-wall harmonic content (sine → 4/π·Σ sin(nωt)/n series). Params: `drive ∈ [1,16]`, `threshold ∈ [1e−6,1]`, `trim ∈ [−24,+12] dB`, `adaa` bool default false. State: 2 doubles when ADAA enabled, zero when off. Golden committed `7251c182d54f9898…`. 16/16 math tests PASS (branchless ≡ if-then-else across sweep, drive pushes through threshold, ADAA bounded, ADAA reduces HF on aggressive clip, ADAA block continuity). |
| 134 | chebyshevWS   | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary: **Canon:character §4 "Chebyshev T_k Waveshaper"** (musicdsp.org #230, public-domain) + **Wikipedia "Chebyshev polynomials"** for recurrence/closed-form T_1..T_5. Algorithm: explicit memoryless polynomial sum `y = level · (g_1·T_1(x) + g_2·T_2(x) + g_3·T_3(x) + g_4·T_4(x) + g_5·T_5(x))` with `T_1=x, T_2=2x²−1, T_3=4x³−3x, T_4=8x⁴−8x²+1, T_5=16x⁵−20x³+5x`. Exploits identity `T_k(cos θ) = cos(k·θ)` — feeding a unit-amplitude sinusoid through `T_k` produces exactly the k-th harmonic, so the per-T_k weights `g_k` give precise per-harmonic dialing (mastering exciter / tape-style harmonic injector). Distinct from saturate/hardClip/wavefolder which produce harmonic spectra as a side-effect of nonlinearity — chebyshevWS lets the author specify the spectrum directly. Limitation called out per Canon §4 LIMITS: harmonic-isolation property is exact only for unit-amplitude pure sinusoidal input; complex inputs produce IM, |x|>1 produces large polynomial growth → input clamped to [−1,1] to bound output. Stateless. Params: `g1..g5 ∈ [−2,2]` (defaults g1=1, others=0 → identity), `level ∈ [0,4]`. Golden committed `1dd8f45d00ac1708…`. 16/16 math tests PASS (defaults identity, per-T_k closed-form match across [−1..1] sweep, recurrence `T_{k+1} = 2x·T_k − T_{k−1}` cross-validated, boundary `T_k(1)=1` and `T_k(−1)=(−1)^k`, harmonic-isolation via 32 zero-crossings in 16-cycle cos through T_2 = 2× harmonic, linear combination Σg_k·T_k, level scaling, |x|>1 clamp T_2(2)→1 not 7, stateless reset, defensive nulls, NaN/inf clamp). |
| 135 | diodeLadder   | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary: **Faust `ve.diodeLadder`** (Eric Tarr, 2019 Embedded DSP With Faust Workshop, CCRMA — `vaeffects.lib`, MIT-style STK-4.3 license) + **Will Pirkle AN-6** "Virtual Analog Diode Ladder Filter" (willpirkle.com/Downloads/AN-6DiodeLadderFilter.pdf) for the underlying TPT/ZDF formulation + **Vadim Zavalishin "Art of VA Filter Design" §7** for general ZDF ladder theory. Input shaper: **Faust `ef.cubicnl`** (JOS, STK-4.3) — pregain=10^(2·drive)·x → clip[-1,1] → x−x³/3, then ×1.5. **Verbatim Faust passage in worklet header.** Algorithm: 4-pole ZDF/TPT ladder with trapezoidal state updates `s_i' = 2·y_i − s_i`. Asymmetric stage gains `a1=1, a2=a3=a4=0.5` (diode-pair coupling — distinct from Moog #34 OTA-based 4×identical stages). Pirkle k-compensation: `k = (17 − normFreq^10·9.7)·(Q − 1/√2)/(25 − 1/√2)`. Bilinear pre-warp `wa = (2/T)·tan(wd·T/2)`. Verbatim coefficient anomaly preserved: third feedback subtraction in each cascade uses `*B2*SG3*k` (i.e. SG3, not the canonically-expected SG2) — this is Tarr's verbatim coefficient and we honor it per ship-protocol primary-fidelity rule (one-symbol fix if later proven a typo). 4 doubles state {s1, s2, s3, s4}, reset clears them. Params: `normFreq ∈ [0,1]` (cutoff, exponentially mapped 20 Hz–20 kHz), `Q ∈ [0.7, 20]` (Pirkle-compensated; self-oscillates near 20), `drive ∈ [0,1]` (cubicnl input shaper drive — at 0 pregain=1 near-linear, at 1 pregain=100 hard-clips before ladder for TB-303 acid character), `trim ∈ [-24,+12] dB`. Golden committed `4e4e269c37c0a7f6…`. 11/11 math tests PASS (LP property: 8 kHz attenuated >6 dB vs 100 Hz at midband cutoff, cutoff sweep monotonic, self-oscillation at Q=18 stays bounded over 8 k samples, stateful blocks differ from fresh, reset() returns to clean state, drive=0 near-linear, drive=1 100× pregain hard-clips, cubicnl(0.5)·1.5 ≈ 0.6875 verified, trim ±6 dB ratio = 1.995, defensive nulls, NaN/inf clamp). |
| 136 | korg35 (was steinerParker) | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. **Slot renamed from `steinerParker` → `korg35`.** Honest framing: Faust public libraries do not contain a Steiner-Parker port. The closest in-character verbatim primary in hand is the Korg-35 (Korg MS-10 / MS-20 / KARP / Korg 700) — same family of Sallen-Key VA topologies with feedback nonlinearity, same MS-20 target the original slot description cited. A true Steiner-Parker (Synthacon / Crumar Bit-99) port awaits openly accessible primary (Pirkle "Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++" Ch 12 digitization or Stenzel "Synthacon VC3" DAFx digitization). Primary: **Faust `ve.korg35LPF`** (Eric Tarr, 2019 Embedded DSP With Faust Workshop, CCRMA — `vaeffects.lib`, MIT-style STK-4.3 license). **Verbatim Faust passage in worklet header.** Algorithm: 3-state Sallen-Key VA — stage 1 TPT LPF, resolved feedback via `(y1 + s3·B3 + s2·B2)·α0`, stage 3 TPT LPF (output), stage 2 TPT LPF on `K·y_out`. State updates `s_i ← 2·y_i − s_i` (TPT trapezoidal). Bilinear pre-warp `wa = (2/T)·tan(wd·T/2)`. Pirkle K-compensation `K = 2·(Q − 1/√2)/(10 − 1/√2)`. Self-oscillates near Q=10. State: 3 doubles {s1, s2, s3}. Params: `normFreq ∈ [0,1]` (cutoff, exp 20 Hz–20 kHz, default 0.35), `Q ∈ [0.7, 10]` (default 3.5), `trim ∈ [-24,+12] dB`. Diode-feedback nonlinearity (the analog Korg-35's "real" character) tracked as P2 — Tarr's port is the linear ZDF skeleton. HPF variant `ve.korg35HPF` exists in Faust and is reserved as a future slot or `mode` param. Golden committed `982207aa9d92e5f5…`. 10/10 math tests PASS (LP property, cutoff sweep, resonance peaking 4× over Butterworth at Q=8, self-osc bounded at Q=10, stateful blocks, reset() clean, DC gain ≈ 1, trim ±6 dB ratio = 1.995, defensive nulls, NaN/inf clamp). |
| 137 | polyBLEP      | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary: **V. Välimäki and A. Huovilainen, "Antialiasing Oscillators in Subtractive Synthesis," IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, vol. 24, no. 2, pp. 116-125, March 2007 — §III.B "Polynomial Transition Region (polyBLEP)"** — closed-form, widely-documented (paraphrased math-by-definition; primary read for derivation). Algorithm: two-piece quadratic correction subtracted from naive sawtooth `2t−1` to band-limit each downward step over 2 samples. For phase `t ∈ [0,1)` and increment `dt = f/SR`: `polyBLEP(t,dt) = 2p−p²−1 if t<dt (p=t/dt); (p+1)² if t>1−dt (p=(t−1)/dt); 0 otherwise`. Output: `saw(t) = (2t−1) − polyBLEP(t,dt)`. Companion to #82 minBLEP — same use (anti-aliased subtractive saw) but no FFT/event-pool/min-phase machinery, ~10 dB more aliasing at musical pitches but trivially per-voice scalable. State: 1 double (phase). freqMod control input enables linear FM. Params: `freq ∈ [0.01, 20000] Hz` (default 440), `amp ∈ [0,4]` (default 1). Golden committed `bd5c1b01944b030c…`. 14/14 math tests PASS (closed-form polyBLEP correction at 5 boundary points, first-sample output 0 at phase=0, period 440 Hz = 109 samples/cycle exact, amplitude ±1 at low freq, amp scales linearly, alias suppression vs naive saw via max-step comparison at 4 kHz, freqMod adds to base freq, reset() returns clean phase, defensive nulls + NaN/inf clamp). |
| 138 | velvetNoise   | 🚧 | Shipped 2026-04-24. Primary: **M. Karjalainen and H. Järveläinen, "Reverberation Modeling Using Velvet Noise," AES 30th International Conference on Intelligent Audio Environments, March 2007** (originator) + **V. Välimäki, S. Schlecht, J. Pätynen, "Velvet Noise Decorrelator," DAFx 2017** (decorrelator application) + **S. Schlecht, "Optimized Velvet-Noise Decorrelator," DAFx 2018** (density optimization) + **V. Välimäki, B. Holm-Rasmussen, B. Alary, H.-M. Lehtonen, "Late Reverberation Synthesis Using Filtered Velvet Noise," Applied Sciences 7(5), May 2017**. **Math-by-definition** declared: paper PDFs were unretrievable from public DAFx mirrors at ship time but the algorithm itself is universally documented and unambiguous in the broader literature. Algorithm: `Td = round(SR/density)` cell length; for each cell `m`: `k_imp(m) = round(r1·(Td−1))` impulse position with `r1 ~ U[0,1)`, `s_imp(m) = sgn(r2 − 0.5) ∈ {−1,+1}` impulse sign with `r2 ~ U[0,1)`; output `y[m·Td + k] = s_imp(m)·amp` if `k == k_imp(m)` else 0. PRNG: Numerical Recipes 32-bit LCG (a=196314165, c=907633515, m=2^32) — same constants as op_noise so authors composing noise + velvetNoise from a single seed get reproducible co-evolved streams. State: 32-bit LCG state, current cell length, sample-in-cell counter, impulse offset, impulse sign. Density clamped [50, 5000] Hz; Td recomputed on density change, takes effect at next cell boundary. Sparse output (1500 imp/s at 48 kHz → Td=32, 1 in 32 samples non-zero) — when convolved as IR, ~3% of the multiplications of a dense FIR. Foundational primitive for high-quality decorrelators / lush reverb early reflections / convolution-tail substitutes / late-reverb diffusion sections. Distinct from #10 noise (dense Gaussian-like) and #124 crackle (random Poisson burst, no grid structure). Params: `density ∈ [50, 5000] imp/s` (default 1500), `amp ∈ [0,4]` (default 1), `seed ∈ [1, 2^31−1]` (default 22222). Golden committed `038518bd9536deb7…`. 14/14 math tests PASS (exactly one impulse per Td-sample cell over 200 cells, non-zero samples are exactly ±1 — no fractional values, sign distribution balanced over 4000 cells, measured impulse rate 1500/s and 500/s within ±10 of param, same seed → identical sequence, different seed → ≥50 sample differences, reset() restores seed-equivalent state, amp=0.5 halves magnitudes, amp=0 → all zeros, density change applies on next cell boundary, defensive null/NaN-clamp, density clamped to 5000 max). |

### Queued character + EQ ops (#139–#140) — primaries in hand 2026-04-25
Two extension slots added after intake of three Tier-S primary sources
(Whitlock "Audio Transformers" Ballou Handbook chapter, De Paiva 2011
DAFx transformer-emulation paper, Pultec EQP-1A manufacturer manual).
Op-ship line is paused on Phase 4 gate closure — these are queued, not
in flight. Primaries are versioned at `docs/primary_sources/transformers/`
and `docs/primary_sources/pultec/`.

**2026-04-26 update:** #139 xformerSat **shipped ✅+P**. Through-path WDF
implementation (flux-tracker + Eq-34 NL-cap modulating HP corner + Eq-17
Rc hysteresis + HF leakage LP). 18-test math suite, golden, native parity
green at −138 dB worst case (tol −90). Row retained for primary-source
trail.

| 139 | xformerSat | Character / Saturation | 🚧 (2026-04-26) | **De Paiva 2011** "Real-Time Audio Transformer Emulation for Virtual Analog Models" (EURASIP J. Adv. Signal Process., Helsinki/Aalto) — gyrator-capacitor + WDF, parameters extractable from electrical measurements alone (no destructive B-H probing). **Single power-law nonlinearity** `a·\|v\|^n·sign(v)` (Eq 15) applied to two elements: nonlinear capacitor `Cc` for B-H saturation (Eq 16, real-time form Eq 34) and nonlinear resistor `Rc` for hysteresis loss (Eq 17, Eq 18 with `vr` delayed one sample). Real-time cost ~10 mul + 1 LUT-pow per sample. Pair with **Whitlock** "Audio Transformers" (Ballou *Handbook for Sound Engineers* 4e ch.) for physics intuition (volt-second saturation, source/load impedance shaping HF resonance + LF corner). See `depaiva_transformer_emulation.md` + `whitlock_audio_transformers.md`. Five user-facing controls proposed: `drive`, `coreSize` (`a` in Eq 15), `sourceZ` (HF damping + LF corner), `loss` (`b` in Eq 17, 0 = lossless line iso), `air` (leakage HF Q). Paper-validated against **two** guitar-amp OTs (Fender NSC041318 + Hammond T1750V); preset roadmap (`tubeOT` paper-validated; `hammondOT` paper-validated; `line` and `micPre` are engineering extrapolations — flag as "v0 extrapolation" until measurements added). Backs both Pultec OT stage (#140) and standalone "iron" character. |

Six controls: LF freq (20/30/60/100 Hz, stepped) + LF boost + LF atten; HF freq (3/4/5/8/10/12/16 kHz) + HF boost + HF bandwidth + HF atten freq (5/10/20 kHz) + HF atten. **Three character mechanisms in series:** (a) parallel LCR boost (Q≈0.7) + LCR atten (Q≈1.0) networks → "Pultec trick" shelf-with-dip when both engaged at same frequency, (b) tube makeup amplifier (12AX7 + 12AU7) → asymmetric soft-clip with 2nd > 3rd > 4th harmonic ratio, (c) UTC-class output transformer → composes with `xformerSat` (#139) preset `tubeOT`. THD ~3% at 30 Hz under full LF boost confirms De Paiva LF-only saturation characterization. Frequency selectors stay stepped (do not interpolate — authentic behavior is rotary-stepped). Compose order: input gain → LF boost network ⊕ LF atten network → HF boost peak ⊕ HF atten shelf → tube waveshaper → xformerSat → output trim. See `pultec_eqp1a.md`. **Depends on #139 shipping first (or being inlined).** |

## Next-up queue (⬜, easy picks)
(Prior picks abs/stereoWidth/lra all shipped; refresh on next session.)
1. ~~**#34 ladder (Moog)**~~ ✅ shipped (pre-audit; confirmed green this session) — primary **musicdsp.org #24 "Moog VCF"** (mistertoast port). 4-pole LP cascade, inverted FB, cubic soft-clip `y4 -= y4³/6` Taylor-2 tanh self-limiter. Hötvinen 2×OS + per-stage tanh + BP/HP taps tracked as upgrade debt.
2. ~~**#40 adsr**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary was **Canon:synthesis §12** (musicdsp #189, Schoenebeck 2005), NOT Canon:dynamics §5 as previously listed (§5 is the stereo-link peak compressor). Corrected in this pass.
3. ~~**#64 fft**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary was **Wikipedia Cooley-Tukey iterative radix-2 / Cormen Ch. 30** (not QFT §5 as catalog suggested — QFT is convolution-reverb-targeted external tar.gz with known single-precision stability issues). Gate-opener for the spectral family (ifft/stft/convolution) now open.
4. ~~**#65 ifft**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — math-by-definition IDFT (conjugated twiddle +2π/m + 1/N scale) over same Cooley-Tukey passage as #64. Closes spectral round-trip; fft→ifft null-test now a harness primitive.
5. ~~**#66 stft**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary **JOS SASP "Mathematical Definition of the STFT"** + **Harris 1978** Hann window. Default size=1024, hop=256 (75% overlap, COLA-satisfied). Established top-of-loop fire-ordering pattern for streaming block transforms.
6. ~~**#67 istft**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary **JOS SASP "Overlap-Add (OLA) STFT Processing"**. OLA resynth via Cooley-Tukey IDFT + Hann synthesis window; `olaScale = hop/Σw²` compensates Hann² OLA gain. stft→istft round-trip asserted as bounded-peak; exact-null verification is P2 debt.
7. ~~**#63 convolution**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary **JOS MDFT §Convolution**. Direct-form linear FIR `y[n] = Σ h[k]·x[n-k]`; IR captured from `ir` input stream over first `length` samples then frozen. FFT-based overlap-add (Wikipedia §Overlap-add_method) tracked as P2 for long IRs.
8. ~~**#68 phaseVocoder**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary **Bernsee smbPitchShift** (WOL, via TarsosDSP port). Analysis/bin-shift/synthesis at osamp=1 (hop=size, no OLA overlap — one frame in → one frame out). Peak-locking (Puckette/Laroche) + OLA-coordinated osamp≥4 tracked as P2.
9. ~~**#62 mfcc**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary **python_speech_features** (James Lyons, Apache-2.0) + **Wikipedia MFCC**. Pipeline: power spec → mel triangular filterbank → log(+1e-10) → DCT-II. Slot reassigned from Movement/Modulation reserved bucket into Analysis/Spectral. Preemphasis / ceplifter / appendEnergy / ortho DCT scale tracked as P2.
10. ~~**#72 warpedLPC**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary **musicdsp #137** `wAutocorrelate` (first-order allpass chain; `dl[k] = r1 − λ(x[k] − r2)` iterated per lag). Levinson-Durbin reused from #71 lpc. Inverse filter = canonical warped-FIR allpass-chain substitution (not in primary passage — declared deviation). Default λ=0.65 (Bark-like at 48 kHz).
11. ~~**#73 chromagram**~~ ✅ shipped 2026-04-24 — primary **librosa `chroma_stft` + `filters.chroma`** (ISC), derived from **Ellis 2007 `chromagram_E`**. Power spec → log-freq Gaussian filterbank mod octave → L2 col-norm → optional Gaussian dominance window (ctroct=5 oct, octwidth=2) → L∞ per-frame norm. Pitch-class argmax verified musically (A4→9 C-based, 0 A-based; octave invariance 440↔880). Auto-tuning estimation tracked as P2.

### Corpus-sweep extension queue (#141–#176) — 2026-04-26

**Origin.** Sweep of 86 corpus entries across 15 named-gear domains
(Compressors/Limiters, Console, Delay, EQ, Filters, Gates/Expanders/De-essers,
Guitar/Bass Amps, Mastering, Modulation, MultiFX, PreAmps, Reverb,
Saturation/Distortion/Color, Specialty/Exciters/Enhancers, Synths/Drum
Machines). Triage produced ~80 candidates → **30 surviving new ops**
(8 Tier-S + 22 Tier-A) + **17 Tier-B** + 4 merges + 7 param-flags + 23
recipes + 9 kills + 2 defers. Tier-B count reduced to 7 in this catalog
write — additional Tier-B slots will be added when their corpus entries
are next touched (see Tier-B note below).

**Cross-cutting headlines.**
- **Five gain-reduction elements gap.** opto / varMu / FET-VVR /
  diode-bridge / blackmer-VCA were ALL missing pre-sweep. Five new
  Tier-S slots address (#141 optoCell, #142 blackmerVCA, #145 varMuTube,
  #147 fetVVR; diode-bridge composes from #132 diodeClipper + bridge
  topology — recipe registry).
- **Tube preamp atom set.** triodeStage / pushPullPower / phaseInverter /
  cathodeBiasShift / psuRectifierSag should ship as a coherent set
  (#148, #155, #156, #157, #154). Existing #113 tubeSim becomes alias of
  triodeStage-with-defaults once #148 ships.
- **Tape primitive split.** Existing #117 tape stays as integrated
  preset; new sweep extracts wow/flutter (#175 Tier-B) and head-bump EQ
  (#171 Tier-B) as composable atoms per Korg-engineer-style mining.
- **VSTi-corner derisking.** #151 bridgedTNetwork + #152 vactrolLPG +
  #160 companding8bit derisk `deferred_domains_roadmap §9 #1`
  (VSTi exit-criteria) — synth-corpus primitives now have a home.

**Status (all rows).** ⬜ pending the 7-step ship protocol per
`sandbox_op_ship_protocol.md`. Phase 4 native-parity gate applies — every
flip to ✅+P requires Step 6 green.

#### Tier-S — primary in hand, ship-priority

| # | opId | status | family | primary in hand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 141 | optoCell | 🚧 | Dynamics | Shipped 2026-04-26. **Phenomenological LA-2A T4-style optical-isolator GR cell.** Two-state envelope: envFast (asymmetric attack/release per UA spec — 10 ms attack, 60 ms initial release) + envSlow (symmetric one-pole following envFast at 1–15 s program-dep tau). Effective env = max(envFast, envSlow); gain = 1/(1 + responsivity·env²) (LDR ~ 1/intensity² mapping). **Math-by-definition declared** — no peer-reviewed T4 thermal-DSP model exists in literature; topology anchored to Giannoulis-Massberg-Reiss JAES 2012 §feedforward DRC, parameter values anchored to UA blog T4 spec. 21/21 math+stress tests PASS (UA T4 spec verification, program-dependent recovery, block-invariance, SR-invariance, denormal flush, state isolation). Golden `21207891abd4a863…`. Native parity GREEN at −144.5 dB worst case (tol −90). 4 deferred upgrade paths in `sandbox_ops_research_debt.md`: P1 validated thermal-coupling model (when peer-reviewed paper surfaces), P2 tunable LDR exponent, P2 asymmetric slow-env warm-up vs cool-down, P3 Felt 2010 LDR thermal-model paper. Replaces 4 alias names: optoT4, bulbOptoEnvelope, optoCompressorCell, vactrolLPG-as-cell. **First Tier-S character cluster A member shipped — closes 1/5 of dynamics gap.** |
| 142 | blackmerVCA | 🚧 | Dynamics | Shipped 2026-04-26. **Log-add-antilog VCA per Blackmer US Patent 3,714,462** (Tier-S named-inventor patent, expired). Memoryless: `out = (audio · 10^(cv/20)) · (1 + bias · sign(audio · 10^(cv/20))_via_|y|) · trim`. cv interpreted as gain in dB (sandbox-ergonomic; THAT 2180 chip-level −6 mV/dB calibration is upstream of this op). `bias` param adds class-AB even-order distortion (DC + 2H + 4H from `|y_clean|` Fourier series — true 2nd-harmonic content matching dbx character, NOT 3rd-harmonic from sign-preserving distortion). Patent matching spec (Q3/Q4 Vbe within 1 mV at 40 µA) ≈ bias=0.025 → −40 dB 2H ≈ "very low distortion." 24/24 math+stress tests PASS (gain accuracy across ±50 dB, 2H/3H spectral analysis, DC offset verification, block-invariance, SR-invariance, memoryless verification, named-gear claim). Golden `1dd8f45d00ac1708…` (= chebyshevWS prefix because both ops are identity at default params; full hash differs). Native parity bit-identical (0.000e+0 across all 5 canon signals — pure linear multiplier at cv=0). 5 deferred upgrade paths in research-debt: P2 measured 2H curve shape, P3 control feedthrough, P3 control bandwidth, P3 self-noise, recipe-rule for DC blocking. Replaces "vcaFader" alias. **2nd Tier-S character cluster A member shipped — closes 2/5 of dynamics gap.** |

| 145 | varMuTube | 🚧 | Dynamics | Shipped 2026-04-26. **Phenomenological variable-mu tube GR cell** modeling Manley Variable Mu / Fairchild 670 / Altec 436 family. Memoryless. Soft-knee Hill function `gain = 1 / (1 + (cv/cutoffScale)^β)` + even-symmetric distortion (DC + 2H + 4H) that scales with `(1 - gain)` — the canonical vari-mu signature: more compression → more 2H content. **Math-by-definition declared with honest gaps:** 6386/6BC8 datasheets, Pakarinen-Yeh CMJ 2009 PDF, Manley/670 service docs, and Koren site ALL inaccessible during ship session (404/403/paywall). Topology anchor = Giannoulis-Massberg-Reiss JAES 2012 §Soft Knee (Tier-A, accessed this session). Distortion-couples-with-GR principle = general tube-physics folklore (Langford-Smith Ch.13, RCA Tube Manual RC-30 — secondary sources only). 21/21 math+stress tests PASS (gain curve monotonicity, knee tunability, even-only spectrum 2H+4H/no 3H, vari-mu signature ratio test, block-invariance, SR-invariance, memoryless verification). Golden `1dd8f45d00ac1708…` (matches at default identity-pass-through). Native parity bit-identical (0.000e+0 across all 5 canon signals). 7 deferred upgrade paths in research-debt: P1 verbatim datasheet curves (×2 — datasheets + Pakarinen-Yeh), P2 Macak thesis, P2 Manley/670 service docs, P2 tube-stage saturation, P3 asymmetric distortion, P3 thermal dynamics. **3rd Tier-S character cluster A member shipped — closes 3/5 of dynamics gap.** |
| 146 | discreteClassAStage | ⬜ | Character | Topology-parameterized BJT/JFET class-A stage covering Neve / API / SSL / Helios variants. Param `topology: 'neve' \| 'api' \| 'ssl' \| 'helios'` selects bias point + harmonic balance. |
| 147 | fetVVR | 🚧 | Dynamics | Shipped 2026-04-26. **Phenomenological JFET-VVR GR cell** modeling UREI/UA 1176 family (2N3819 JFET, fast attack, aggressive harmonics signature). Memoryless. Hill-function gain curve with sharper β=2 default (vs varMuTube's 1.5 — matches FET pinch-off curve steeper than vari-mu). **Distinguishing distortion model:** independent `distortion2H` (even, FET asymmetric channel) + `distortion3H` (odd, FET pinch-off non-linearity) → mixed 2H+3H character. "All buttons in" reputation available via crank-both-distortion params. **Math-by-definition declared:** 1176 service manual + 2N3819 datasheet inaccessible at ship time. Topology anchor = GMR JAES 2012 §Soft Knee. FET ohmic-region Rds(V_GS) equation captured verbatim from Wikipedia JFET article (Tier-A textbook). 21/21 math+stress tests PASS (gain monotonicity, sharper-knee-than-varMuTube verification, 2H-only with d3=0, 3H-only with d2=0, mixed 2H+3H, "all buttons in" character, comprDepth coupling). Golden `1dd8f45d00ac1708…`. Native parity bit-identical (0.000e+0 across all 5 canon signals — pass-through at cv=0). 7 deferred upgrade paths in research-debt: P1 verbatim 1176 service manual + 2N3819 datasheet, P2 measured distortion-vs-GR curves, P2 "all buttons in" piecewise plateau onset, P2 attack/release dynamics absorption, P3 tube-stage saturation, P3 asymmetric polarity. **4th Tier-S character cluster A member shipped — closes 4/5 of dynamics gap.** |

Kernel: Kaiser-windowed sinc (β=7 → ~70 dB stopband). Theory page validates downsample cutoff scaling `hs(t) = min{1,Fs'/Fs}·sinc(min{Fs,Fs'}·t)`. **v1 implements speed=1 (filter delay) + speed<1 (varispeed read) cleanly; speed>1 has causality clamp at NZ-minimum (no lookahead).** Native parity green at −Inf dB (bit-identical at speed=1). 14/14 math tests PASS (kernel construction, identity, frequency-halving at 0.5×, clamp behavior, defensive). Golden committed `905784a447df1755…`. Deviations from JOS: float-point time register (vs JOS's fixed-point bitfield partition), no kernel cutoff scaling (P1 in `sandbox_ops_research_debt.md` #166-b), no elastic buffering (P2 #166-a).

#### Tier-B — promoted from kill-list re-triage

| # | opId | status | family | rationale |

**Tier-B note.** Sweep produced 17 Tier-B candidates total; 7 written
above (#170–#176) + 6 recovered in dedup pass below (#178–#183). 4

(bbdLine→bbdCompander recipe, aphexPhaseCompensator→aphexHarmonicGenerator
recipe, kepexExpander→gateStateMachine, omnipressorRatio→ratioCurveBank
flag) — see Notes in §Dedup recovery.

#### Dedup-recovery pass (#177–#183) — 2026-04-26

Targeted second pass over the 15-domain corpus to close the 11-slot gap
between original synthesis (47 new) and first-write count (36). Recovery
found 7 ops with confident primary backing; honest stop short of the
projected 11 to avoid duplicate-or-recipe hallucination.

Hill function (β=1.8 between varMuTube's 1.5 and fetVVR's 2.0) + **PURE-ODD 3H distortion from cubic** (`distortion · comprDepth · x³ · gain`) — diode-bridge topology symmetry cancels even harmonics. Optional `asymmetry` adds small 2H+4H for component-mismatch realism. **Critical model adjustment caught + fixed during ship:** initial `y³ = (x·gain)³` produced 3H/1H ratio that DROPPED with compression (wrong direction); fixed by `x³·gain` form so ratio depends purely on comprDepth (matches real Neve behavior — distortion rises with GR). **Math-by-definition declared:** Neve 2254 schematic, 33609 user manual, Ben Duncan "VCAs Investigated", SoS reviews, Gearspace forum, Wikipedia 33609/2254 articles ALL inaccessible at ship time.

- **Collapsed candidates** (proposed during recovery, not slotted): `bbdLine` → covered by #112 bbdDelay + #160 companding8bit composition; `aphexPhaseCompensator` → covered by aphexHarmonicGenerator recipe; `kepexExpander` → covered by #153 gateStateMachine + ratio params; `omnipressorRatio` → covered by ratioCurveBank flag on compressor family; `analogClap`, `phaseShiftLFO`, `slidingBandFilter` → all collapse onto shipped atoms or queued recipes.
- **Skipped:** `karplusStrong` — not surfaced strongly in corpus (DX7 plucked-string is FM-emulated, no dedicated KS unit). Defer until physical-modeling corpus pass per `deferred_domains_roadmap §3` VSTi exit criteria.
- **Sweep total reconciled:** 8 Tier-S + 22 Tier-A (21 first-write + 1 recovery) + 13 Tier-B (7 first-write + 6 recovery) = **43 new slots**, not the originally-projected 47. The 4-slot delta is the 4 candidates that collapsed to existing atoms during recovery — honest synthesis correction, not a write-side miss.

#### Merges (no new slot — capability folds into existing op)

| existing op | absorbs | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| #117 tape | tape-bias-coupling sub-feature | adds `bias` param flag (separate op #169 tapeBias remains for standalone use) |
| (#141 optoCell) | optoT4 / bulbOptoEnvelope / optoCompressorCell / vactrolLPG-as-cell | 4 alias names → single slot at ship time |
| (#142 blackmerVCA) | vcaFader | alias closed into this slot |
| (#165 voiceCoilCompression) | alnicoSag | folds in as `magnetType` flag |
| (#152 vactrolLPG) | ldrPhaserStage | folds in as `cellModel` flag — phaser-stage variant of vactrol |
| (#148 triodeStage) | #113 tubeSim deprecation | once #148 ships, #113 becomes alias of triodeStage-with-defaults |

#### Param-flags on existing ops (no new slots)

7 capability flags surfaced by the sweep that should be added to
existing ops at next-touch:

| op | new param/flag | rationale |
|---|---|---|
| #34 ladder (Moog) | `topology: 'moog' \| 'transistor' \| 'ota'` | unifies with #149 otaLadder when shipped |
| #136 korg35 | `mode: 'lp' \| 'hp'` | Faust ve.korg35HPF reserve from original ship |
| (compressor family) | `gainComputer.topology: 'feedforward' \| 'feedback'` | corpus disambiguates per-unit topology declaration (already exists on engine.capabilities — formalize as op param) |
| (compressor family) | `envelope.release: 'linear' \| 'log' \| 'program-dependent'` | covers SSL / 1176 / LA-2A spread |
| #6 lfo | `shape: 'sine' \| 'triangle' \| 'staircase' \| 'random' \| 'varistor'` | absorbs varistor-style asymmetric LFO without new op |
| #15 bitcrush | `companding: 'linear' \| 'mu-law' \| 'a-law'` | distinct from #160 companding8bit (which is the full encode→decimate→decode pipeline) |
| #20 fdnCore | `diffusion.matrix: 'hadamard' \| 'householder' \| 'random-orthogonal'` | corpus-flagged FDN matrix variants |

#### Kills (9 — composed from existing primitives, no slot)

`brickwallLimiter`, `multibandCompressor`, `deEsser`, `pingPongDelay`,
`tapeDelay` (already kill in 2026-04-24 gap-audit), `parametricEQ`,
`vocoder`, `autoTune`, `ambisonics` — all compose from shipped primitives
at the brick layer. Recipes documented in pending `recipe_registry.md`.

#### Defers (2 — agent-pipeline scope, not sandbox primitive)

- `kemperProfile` — capture/profile pipeline; belongs to agent-pipeline
  layer, not op layer. Defer until Agent Layer Roadmap gate review.
- `vssRayTrace` — VSS / wavefield-simulated reverb ray-tracing; defer
  to deferred_domains_roadmap §5 (multichannel spatial domain).

## Notes on reconstruction
- Slot #17 (dcBlock) is outside the Space/Filters family ranges shown in the
  original family table; assigned here because dcBlock is ship-critical but
  doesn't neatly fit "generic onePole" at #32.
- Slots `#18`, `#47–#50` surplus, `#100–#102`, `#126`, `#130` left
  as _reserved_ — can be reassigned when the need arises.
- Duplicate listings (adsr in both Dynamics & Synth, lookahead in both
  Dynamics & Time, crepe in both Pitch & ML): same op, one slot, cross-ref.
- When adding a new op: update registry + ship tri-file + **update this file's
  status column** before closing the task.

## Locked primaries — 2026-04-26 (Perplexity 2-of-2 confirmation)

**Status.** 37 of 52 ops in the corpus-sweep extension queue have **Tier-S
or Tier-A primaries locked** by 2-of-2 agreement between two independent
Perplexity Deep Research runs (see `op_primaries_perplexity_diff.md`).
This section is the authoritative source for the locked citations; rows
in the queue tables above retain their original "primary in hand"
sketches as initial provenance. **When shipping any op below, cite the
locked primary from this section in the worklet header.**

### Locked from follow-up Perplexity run (14 ops resolved 2026-04-26)

The 14 originally-pending ops have been re-researched in a focused
follow-up Perplexity run (see `op_primaries_followup_results.md`).
**11 of 14 are now cleanly resolved**; 3 retain partial unresolved
items that don't block ship.

Catalog corrections applied below. **For these ops, cite the locked
primary from this section** (overrides any earlier "primary in hand"
text in the queue tables).

| catalog # | opId | locked primary | tier | correction notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #148 | triodeStage | Koren, "Improved Vacuum Tube Models for SPICE Simulations," *Glass Audio* 8(5):18, 1996; web update 2003 (normankoren.com/Audio/Tubemodspice_article.html) | Tier-A (confirmed; not peer-reviewed) | **No Tier-S upgrade exists.** Pakarinen-Yeh CMJ 2009 is Tier-A bonus that contextualizes Koren in peer-reviewed literature. |
| #152 | vactrolLPG | Buchla & Associates, Model 292 Quad Voltage-Controlled Lopass Gate service docs (fluxmonkey.com Historic Buchla / vasulka.org / buchla.com archives); + Lefort, Cantor-Echols, Abel, "A Digital Model of the Buchla Lowpass-Gate," DAFx-2013, Maynooth | Tier-S (service docs) / Tier-A (DAFx-2013 backup) | **CORRECTION:** No Don Buchla 1965 patent for the LPG exists. **US 3,475,623 is a Moog patent, NOT Buchla** — remove that citation if previously listed. Drop original prompt's "1965" claim. |
| #153 | gateStateMachine | Giannoulis, Massberg, Reiss, "Digital Dynamic Range Compressor Design — A Tutorial and Analysis," *JAES* 60(6):399–408, June 2012 (AES E-Library elib:16354) | **Tier-A** (peer-reviewed JAES, covers gate/expander FSM) | **CORRECTION:** Drugan-Reiss 2017 AES paper **could not be located** in any of three Perplexity runs — drop as primary. musicdsp #117 demoted to "weak supplementary" not primary. Giannoulis-Massberg-Reiss 2012 is the clean Tier-A anchor. |
| #154 | psuRectifierSag | Macak, Schimmel, "Real-Time Guitar Tube Amplifier Simulation Using an Approximation of Differential Equations," DAFx-2010, Graz (dafx.de paper archive) | Tier-A | **CORRECTION:** Yeh-Abel-Smith DAFx-2007 explicitly does **NOT** cover PSU rectifier sag (paper is on diode-clipper / Tube Screamer pedal circuits only). Macak-Schimmel 2010 simulates push-pull tube power amp + transformer + loudspeaker loading; PSU dynamics inherent. Yeh-Abel-Smith remains valid for #132 diodeClipper context, NOT for this op. |
| #159 | dopplerRotor | Leslie, Donald J., "Rotatable Tremulant Sound Producer," US Patent 2,489,653 (filed 1945-07-09, granted 1949-11-29) | Tier-S | US 2,855,462 (Run A's citation) **could not be confirmed** in any Perplexity run as a Leslie patent — verify against hammond-leslie.com/DonLesliesPatents/ before citing elsewhere. Leslie's companion vibrato patents US 2,622,692 + US 2,622,693 (1952) and rotary electrostatic speaker US 3,058,541 (1962) are bonus references. Henricksen 1981 *Recording Engineer/Producer* (NOT JAES — verify) is Tier-A backup. |
| #162 | ringMod | Keith, Clyde R., "Frequency Translating System," US Patent 1,855,576 (filed 1929-04-09, granted 1932-04-26; assignee: Bell Telephone Laboratories) | Tier-S | **CORRECTION:** Run B attributed US 1,855,576 to Cowan — that's wrong. **Keith is the inventor.** Cowan's improvement patent is **US 2,025,158** (1935). Both can be cited but with correct attribution. Bode 1984 JAES retrospective is Tier-A bonus; Bode 1961 *Electronics* is Tier-B (trade article, not peer-reviewed). |
| #164 | hilbert | Schüssler, H. W., Steffen, P., "Halfband Filters and Hilbert Transformers," *Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing* 17(2):137–164, 1998 (DOI: 10.1007/BF01202851) | Tier-A | **1998 date confirmed.** Run A's "1988 Prentice Hall chapter in Lim & Oppenheim *Advanced Topics in Signal Processing*" is a real prior publication but the 1998 CSSP journal paper is the operative citation for the IIR allpass-pair design method. |
| #165 | voiceCoilCompression | Klippel, Wolfgang, "Loudspeaker Nonlinearities — Causes, Parameters, Symptoms," *JAES* 54(10):907–939, October 2006 (AES E-Library elib:13881; free PDF at klippel.de) | **Tier-S** (originator + peer-reviewed JAES) | Confirmed — Run A correct, Run B's Tier-A wrong per tier definition. |
| #172 | oilCanDelay | Lubow, Raymond, "Delay Apparatus," US Patent 2,892,898 (filed 1958-02-21, granted 1959-06-30) — electrostatic delay using rotating anodized aluminum disc + neoprene-graphite electrodes + oil/wax lubrication | Tier-S | **CORRECTION:** Echoplex EP-3 is **tape echo, NOT oil-can** — drop EP-3 reference from this op. Tel-Ray (Fender Ad-N-Echo / Echo-Reverb) units are the canonical oil-can examples. US 2,963,554 (Run B's alt citation) **could not be confirmed** at Google Patents. Earlier related Lubow patent US 2,837,597 (1958) cited as prior art in 2,892,898. |
| #175 | wowFlutter | Two-layer citation: **(standards)** IEC 386:1971 "Methods of Measuring Wow and Flutter in Sound Recording and Reproducing Equipment" (also DIN 45507; modern: AES6-2008); **(theory)** Bertram, *Theory of Magnetic Recording*, Cambridge UP 1994, Ch.7 transport mechanics | Tier-S (IEC standard) + Tier-A (Bertram) | Run B's two-layer split confirmed — both citations needed. |
| #176 | varistorVibrato | Shin-ei Companion / Univox Uni-Vibe original schematic (model 905, 1968) — univox.org/schematics.html or Scribd doc 350358305; + Pestana, Barbosa, "Digital Grey Box Model of The Uni-Vibe Effects Pedal," DAFx-2019, Birmingham | Tier-S (schematic) / Tier-A (DAFx-2019) | **NAMING CORRECTION FLAG:** Uni-Vibe uses **LDRs** (CDS photoresistors, MXY-7BX4) modulated by an incandescent lamp — **NOT varistors**. The op name `varistorVibrato` is technically inaccurate; consider rename to `lampLDRVibrato` or `optoVibrato`. Component name "varistor" and "VDR" are synonyms but neither is the operative component in the Uni-Vibe. |
| #177 | fmOperator | Chowning, John M., "The Synthesis of Complex Audio Spectra by Means of Frequency Modulation," *JAES* 21(7):526–534, September 1973 | **Tier-S** (originator + peer-reviewed JAES — textbook example) | Confirmed — Run A correct. **Bonus:** Stanford FM patent **US 4,018,121** (Chowning, filed 1973, issued 1977) — Tier-S named-inventor patent covering the phase-modulation variant Yamaha licensed for the DX7. Add to row. |
| #182 | blesserReverbCore | Blesser, Barry & Bäder, Karl-Otto, US Patent **4,181,820** (filed 1978-04-21, granted 1980-01-01) | Tier-S | **CORRECTION:** **US 3,978,289 is NOT a Blesser patent** — it appears to be a Cummins industrial V-ribbed belt part number. **Remove from catalog entirely.** Bonus Tier-A: Blesser, Baeder, Zaorski, "A Real-Time Digital Computer for Simulating Audio Systems," *JAES* 23(9):698–707, 1975 (AES E-Library elib:2659) — likely the journal version of the AES 50th Convention London 1975 paper. |
| #139 sub-preset | inputXformerSat | Whitlock, Bill — Jensen Application Notes AN-001 / AN-003 / AN-008 (jensen-transformers.com/application-notes/) — manufacturer technical documentation by named expert with measured B-H data | **Tier-S** (manufacturer docs by named expert) | **Bonus Tier-A:** Whitlock, "Audio Transformers," Ch.11 in Ballou (ed.), *Handbook for Sound Engineers* 4e, Focal Press 2008 — peer-reviewed/edited textbook version of AN-008. |

### Still unresolved (3 partial items — non-blocking)

These have a clean primary locked but a secondary citation requires
direct USPTO / AES E-Library / archive lookup. Ship-protocol can
proceed with the locked primary; verify these when convenient.

- **#159 dopplerRotor:** Verify US 2,855,462 against hammond-leslie.com/DonLesliesPatents/ (or drop reference to it).
- **#172 oilCanDelay:** Verify US 2,963,554 at USPTO / Google Patents directly (or drop reference to it).
- **#153 gateStateMachine:** Verify Drugan-Reiss 2017 AES paper at aes.org/e-lib/ (Giannoulis-Massberg-Reiss 2012 already locked as primary, so this is supplementary only).

### 3rd-source verification overlay (Claude Deep Research, 2026-04-26)

Claude follow-up surfaced corrections that **override** the Perplexity-locked
rows above. Where Claude and Perplexity disagree, **Claude is correct** —
each correction below was verified against primary sources (Google Patents,
AES E-Library, DAFx archive).

| catalog # | What Claude corrected vs Perplexity follow-up |
|---|---|
| **#152 vactrolLPG** | DAFx-13 paper authors: **Parker-D'Angelo**, NOT Lefort-Cantor-Echols-Abel. Service-doc primary is **Buchla 200 Series Schematics** (archive.org `sm_Buchla_200_Series_Schematics`). Series 100 deliberately not patented. VTL5C3 vactrol family identified as canonical component. |
| **#153 gateStateMachine** | Drugan-Reiss 2017 confirmed **fabricated** (Reiss has no co-author named Drugan; not in 143rd AES Conv NYC Oct 2017 program). Anchor switched: Perplexity locked Giannoulis-Massberg-Reiss 2012 (generic compressor design); **Claude recommends Terrell-Reiss DAFx-09 + EURASIP 2010 extension** (directly noise-gate-focused, CC-BY 2.0, more topically appropriate). DAFx-09 wins. |
| **#154 psuRectifierSag** | Section is **§7 "Output Power Amp Simulation"**, NOT §3.2 (Perplexity error). Sag treated via series rectifier resistor RD with reservoir cap C2: "the combination of RD and C2 also simulates power amplifier compression (sagging effect)." Collaborator name is **Schimmel** (Perplexity inconsistent). **Bonus Tier-A:** Macak-Schimmel EURASIP 2011 Article 629309 — peer-reviewed extension. |
| **#159 dopplerRotor** | Patent title is **"Rotatable Tremulant Sound Producer"** (Claude-verified), NOT "Electrical Musical Instrument." US 2,855,462 (original prompt) **unverifiable as a Leslie patent** — drop. **Henricksen 1981 *JAES* 29(6):392–399 citation does not exist** — actual is *Recording Engineer/Producer* April 1981 (Tier-B). Both Perplexity runs accepted the bogus JAES citation unchallenged. **Bonus citations:** US RE 23,323 (1951 reissue), US 2,622,693 (1952), US 3,058,541 (1962 rotary electrostatic). |
| **#162 ringMod** | Bode 1961 *Electronics* exact title: **"Sound Synthesizer Creates New Musical Effects"** (Dec 1, 1961), NOT "A New Tool for the Manipulation of Sound" (Perplexity quoted wrong title). Keith vs Cowan attribution confirmed. **Bonus citations:** Bode "History of Electronic Sound Modification" *JAES* 32(10):730–739 (Oct 1984) AES e-lib 4481 — Tier-S originator review; Bode-Moog "A High-Accuracy Frequency Shifter" *JAES* 20(6):453 (Jul/Aug 1972) — Tier-S; Bode 1961 *JAES* 9(4):264–266 AES e-lib 455. |
| **#172 oilCanDelay** | Tel-Ray paired patent is **US 3,072,543** ("Dielectric Signal Storage Device," Lubow & Lubow, 1963 — Claude verified directly on Google Patents with full text), NOT US 2,963,554 (Perplexity unverified). Tel-Ray Adineko service plates stamp **both** US 2,892,898 + US 3,072,543 — canonical pair. **Decouple Echoplex EP-3 from this op** — EP-3 is tape, not oil-can. Likely Battle/Maestro tape patent: **US 3,444,330** (May 1969) — needs separate `tapeEcho` op when verified. Operative mechanism = electrostatic charge storage on anodized-aluminum disc with particle-loaded dielectric film, NOT "electrolytic capacitor charge sloshing." |
| **#176 varistorVibrato → rename `ldrVibrato`** | DAFx-19 paper authors: **Darabundit-Wedelich-Bischoff** (Claude verification, ccrma.stanford.edu/~champ/files/DAFx2019_paper_31.pdf), NOT Pestana-Barbosa (Perplexity error). Shin-ei FY-2 is the *Companion Fuzz*, NOT the Uni-Vibe (Perplexity conflated). Uni-Vibe is canonically a 4-stage all-pass **phaser**; "vibrato" mode is wet-only routing, not pitch-mod vibrato. Service manual on archive.org could not be located directly; **GeoFex NeoVibe PDF is the canonical accessible reproduction** of the original Univox/Unicord schematic (geofex.com/Article_Folders/univibe/vibeupdate.pdf). **Op rename to `ldrVibrato` recommended** — varistor is a category error (MOV/VDR vs LDR are different device classes). |
| **#182 blesserReverbCore** | Patent title is "**Electric** Reverberation Apparatus" (Claude-verified), NOT "Electronic" (catalog metadata error). AES 50th Convention London 1975 preprint: **L-26** (AES e-lib id 2460), same paper as JAES 23(9):698–707 (e-lib id 2659). **Bonus Tier-A:** Blesser & Lee, "An Audio Delay System Using Digital Technology," *JAES* 19(5):393–397 (May 1971), AES e-lib 2172 — foundational digital-delay predecessor. Spelling: German "Bäder" ≡ "Baeder" (JAES) ≡ "Bader" (US patent). |
| **#139 sub-preset inputXformerSat** | **Tier corrected from S → A.** Jensen ANs are educational/tutorial materials authored by Whitlock, NOT service manuals or measurement-traceable test reports. AN-008 = verbatim Whitlock chapter from Ballou *Handbook for Sound Engineers* 3e (2001). Tier-A "textbook chapter by recognized authority" clause applies cleanly. **For genuine Tier-S manufacturer-documentation with measured B-H/saturation data** the catalog needs to cite individual transformer datasheets (JT-11P-1, JT-10KB-D, etc.), not the AN series. ANs are **AN-001 through AN-009** (not just AN-008). |

### Op-rename + decoupling actions (3 catalog metadata changes pending)

When the relevant ops ship, apply these renames + decouplings:
1. **#176 `varistorVibrato` → `ldrVibrato`** (rename — `varistor` is a category error; the operative component is a CdS LDR, not a voltage-dependent resistor).
2. **#172 oilCanDelay** — strip all Echoplex EP-3 references. EP-3 is tape; spawn a separate `tapeEcho` op anchored to the Battle/Maestro patent (likely US 3,444,330) when that patent is independently confirmed. Tel-Ray Adineko / Fender Ad-N-Echo / Echo-Reverb remain the canonical oil-can examples.
3. **#152 vactrolLPG** — strike all "1965 Buchla LPG patent" references and any "US 3,475,623" attribution (US 3,475,623 is **Robert Moog's** transistor-ladder VCF patent). The LPG was deliberately never patented; primary is the factory schematic.

### Triangulated final tally

- **48 of 52 ops** have locked primaries from 3-of-3 or 4-of-4 agreement (Perplexity A + Perplexity B + Perplexity follow-up + Claude)
- **9 of 14** previously-pending ops had **fact errors** in Perplexity that Claude caught and corrected (overlay above is authoritative)
- **3 ops** have partial-unresolved supplementary citations (don't block ship)
- **3 op-metadata changes pending** (rename / decouple — see above)
- **1 op** (#161 aliasingDecimator) has no Tier-S/A primary in literature; locked at JOS PASP fallback as research-debt
